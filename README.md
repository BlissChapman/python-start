# Exercises for learning Programming Concepts and Python

Welcome to a short tutorial on the some fundamental programming concepts in the form of short exercises. 
We'll go through how to create and use functions, how to use a computer to solve math equations, loops, and advanced functions!

Hopefully, what you learn here can be applied to your own classes and projects. We may even hold some sort of competition where you can test your skills :)

## How to get Python installed

### Mac/Linux

Python should come preinstalled on your computer, but you may want to install a different version from the one your operating system uses. In this case, ask an officer or ping me (berwin) to help you out.

### Windows

Follow [this guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/) to install python on your computer, including the section that you run a command in `powershell`. You can look for Powershell on your computer by pressing the Windows key and typing in `powershell`. You should get a blue window terminal where you will paste the command from the guide. Once it is installed, you may have to restart Powershell and by typing `python` + Enter, you should be able to see
if it was successfully installed.

## How to test your code

There are files inside the directory that are appended with `_tester` which you will have to run to test the code you write in the other .py files. To do this, type
```
python [tester_file.py]
```
with `tester_file.py` being replaced by whichever section you are working on.
